# 📱 Flutter Apps Collection  

This repository contains all the Flutter apps I have developed while learning and experimenting with different concepts.  
Each app is built from scratch, and I learned by making mistakes, debugging, and improving step by step.  
Sometimes AI helped me understand things faster, but at the end of the day, **a developer must know and build everything** 💻✨.
